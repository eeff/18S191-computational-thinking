# 18.S191: Introduction to computational thinking for real-world problems

My notebooks for **MIT 18.S191 aka 6.S083 aka 22.S092**, **Fall 2023** edition.
[The course](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/) uses the [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org) to approach real-world problems in varied areas applying data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.

Topics include:

-   Image analysis
-   Machine Learning
-   Network theory
-   Climate modeling
